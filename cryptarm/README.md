Some Encryption Algorithms in ARM and X86 assembly

Each folder contains 2 assembly files. 1 for x86 using .ASM extension, the other for ARM using .S extension.
They only perform encryption.

To assemble x86 on windows requires MSVC and YASM, and that paths already be setup for them.
To assemble ARM on Linux requires the GNU C compiler and GNU Assembler.
