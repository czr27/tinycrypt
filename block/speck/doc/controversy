<p>As of 2018, strong variants of SPECK and SIMON remain unbroken. However, the 30% security margin provided by the ciphers that hasn't prevented some in the cryptographic community being cynical about the intentions of the NSA. <a href="http://www.cs.haifa.ac.il/~orrd/">Orr Dunkelman</a>, a computer science professor at the University of Haifa commented. <em><strong>"I donâ€™t trust the designers"</strong></em> and <em><strong>"There are quite a lot of people in NSA who think their job is to subvert standards. My job is to secure standards."</strong></em> <a href="https://cr.yp.to/djb.html">Daniel Bernstein</a> also commented: <em><strong>NSA says:We need a "generalist" cipher that works well everywhere, so here are 20 incompatible Simon+Speck variants https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/585</strong></em> As most of the attacks appear ad-hominem, is it fair to dismiss Speck and Simon even when the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/560">rationale behind the designs have been published</a> When asked if it could beat Simon and Speck encryption, NSA officials are reported to have said: "<em><strong>We firmly believe they are secure.</strong></em>" which neither confirms nor denies NSA can break these type of ciphers. 

Then again, if the NSA are capable of breaking Speck and Simon, they may also know how to break other ARX designs like ChaCha, LEA and CHAM?

A final vote on whether Speck/Simon are accepted as part of an ISO standard takes place in February 2018.

There's some interesting speculation on the reasons for publishing Simon and Speck in post to a crypto mailing list <em><a href="http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2015-August/026312.html">Speculation on the origin of Speck and Simon</a></em>
